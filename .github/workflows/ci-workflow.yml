jobs:
  # Single job responsible for running the full test pipeline
  test:
    # Use GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner
    # Docker and Docker Compose are available by default
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Clone repository into the runner environment
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Build images and run docker compose
      # If the test container exits with non-zero exit code,
      # this step fails and the job status becomes "failure"
      - name: Build and run with Docker Compose
        run: |
          docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
          docker compose down

      # If tests pass (exit code 0), success() condition becomes true

      # Step 3: Create a file named "succeeded"
      # This file serves as proof that tests completed successfully

        run: |

      # If any previous step failed (including docker compose),
      # failure() condition becomes true

      # Step 5: Create a file named "fail"
      # This indicates that tests did not pass
